Soul Blazer Randomizer tracker using the EmoTracker program.

## Usage

Upon installing this tracker, use standard operations similar to EmoSaru's ALTTPR tracker: left click items to turn them on, right click to turn them off.

More features are planned for this tracker, and issues can be raised as usual.
