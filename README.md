# Soul Blazer PopTracker Pack
Soul Blazer Randomizer tracker using the PopTracker program.  Supports both the standalone and Archipelago versions.

Note: Autotracking support is currently better for the Archipelago veresion, although I intend to work on this later.

## Usage

Upon installing this tracker, use standard PopTracker operations: left click items to turn them on, right click to turn them off.
Auto-tracking will override most of the things you can click, though.

The Settings section exists for the map-enabled variants, you toggle these like you would any other checks.

More features are planned for this tracker, and issues can be raised as usual.
